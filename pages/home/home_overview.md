## Benefits of SpiderWare


- **Deployment**

If you already have an existing solution, you can further enhance it by integrating SpiderWare. If you are starting from scratch, you can use SpiderWare as a stand-alone system to build your product on.

- **Ease of Integration**

Link directly to SpiderWare as a library.Alternatively, SpiderWare can run as a separate process, that your system can talkto via inter-process communication (IPC).

- **Small Footprint**

SpiderWare has a binary footprint as small as 4MB!This gives it the flexibility to be deployed either as a standard application or as an embedded solution.

- **High Connectivity**

By employing the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol in combination with STUN and TURN protocols, establishing peer-to-peer connections between two endpoints is simple and quick.

- **Cross-Platform**

Seamless interoperability and functional parity across web, mobile and desktop.

- **Secure Streaming**

All Audio, Video and meta-data streams are securely peer-to-peer encrypted, as is the signaling mechanism.


- **Fully Customizable**

SpiderWare embeds seamlessly in your application or device, without interfering with your brand experience. You have full control to create the website or application you want.


- **SpiderWare Ecosystem**

SpiderWare enables devices to ‘talk’ to each other. Given this premise, it is possible to create an ecosystem where SpiderWare powered devices can exchange information and work together



## Deployment

On practically everything! It runs on Windows, Linux, Mac OSX. It can be hosted on a robust server or on a small ARM based IP Camera, or anything in-between.
