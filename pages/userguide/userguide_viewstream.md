Once the SpiderWare has started,it will find the camera and audio source from the device it was installed. 

In this example, we are using the ExM as our signaling server. 

1. Create a session in ExM *(make sure that the configurations in config.json in your SpiderWare matches with the entry in the ExM)*

2. Open the ExM Viewer at https://exm.evostream.com/

3. The username should reflect in the connected users pane

4. Click on the username. This will open the WebRTC player and your stream is already playing.
